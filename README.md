# Crime-Analysis-in-Maharashtra-using-WEKA-
This project analyzes crime trends across 35 districts in the state of Maharashtra, India, using data mining and machine learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns and support law enforcement decision-making.

📊 Project Overview
The study applies Linear Regression and Expectation-Maximization (EM) Clustering on crime data to identify regional crime patterns and improve predictive accuracy. The project is executed using the WEKA data mining tool.

📁 Dataset
Source: Kaggle

Records: Crime data across 35 districts

Categories: 11 types of crime

🛠️ Tools & Techniques
Software: WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis)

Techniques:

Linear Regression for crime rate prediction

EM Clustering for grouping districts based on crime intensity

📈 Key Findings
Effective segmentation of districts helps in strategic resource allocation.

High correlation between actual and predicted crime rates validates the model.

EM clustering reveals distinct crime behavior patterns across regions.

🎯 Outcome
Supports evidence-based policing and better crime prevention planning.

Helps law enforcement prioritize efforts based on cluster-specific needs.

📌 Conclusion
This study demonstrates the potential of data mining to extract actionable insights from large crime datasets. Future enhancements can include the use of real-time data, more advanced machine learning models, and integration with other sources (e.g., social media, mobile data) to increase accuracy and im
